<p id="description">This is a simple file merger for JW Library backup files. There is a website made with flask and hosted on pythonanywhere for anyonw who don't know how to set up a Python environment. I'm not an expert so my script is really simple but it works! So if you have any suggestions or tips for more improvements or upgrades I would be really happy and I will appreciate that. Thanks.</p>
